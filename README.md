# ATR (Automatic Target Recognition)
The novel capsule network architecture is computationally expensive and requires a lot of training time. Modifications in the primary layer of the architecture and decoder network will improve the response time of target recognition. 

Steps to run the notebooks:
1] Upload the required dataset in google drive and as it will be mounted in the code. 
2] Run all the cells in the notebook.

Delete the previous ./mycapsule checkpoints before running again.
