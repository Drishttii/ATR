# ATR (Automatic Target Recognition)
The novel capsule network architecture is computationally expensive and requires a lot of training time. Modifications in the primary layer of the architecture and decoder network will improve the response time of target recognition. 

Steps to run the notebooks: <br />
1] Upload the required dataset in google drive and as it will be mounted in the code. <br />
2] Run all the cells in the notebook. <br />

Delete the previous ./mycapsule checkpoints before running again. <br />

# Dataset: 
- MSTAR dataset: (https://www.sdms.afrl.af.mil/index.php?collection=mstar) <br />

Download the public MSTAR targets dataset from here.
